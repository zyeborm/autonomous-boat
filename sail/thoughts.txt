Thinking, maybe a single wing...
changes;
a little larger then one of the proposed wings

pros;
only one sail moter to run.
less deck shadding.
Less weight up high.
most probably have same number of PV cells as on the 2 wings, will fit on the larger wing
can tapper the wing at top.
moving the mast to center of boat where keel is maybe a stronger build.

cons;
no backup.
only one mast to mount wind sensor and gps on.
backup wind sensor on deck will not get as clearer reading as on mast.

next;
Can try on test boat when electrics are up and running
