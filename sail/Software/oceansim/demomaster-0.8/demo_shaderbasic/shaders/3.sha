This is time we write our first shader that passes explicitly information from
the vertex shader to the fragment shader and we talk a bit more about linear
interpolation.

In the last shader examples you may have never seen that there was any linear
interpolation, but there was. If we only draw one triangle on the screen we only
need three vertices. So vshader is called three times. If this triangle is large
our fshader is called 100'000 times and more. What happens here between? The GPU
starts to render a triangle (that is one thing a GPU can without any help). But
how does the GPU connect e.g. vertex 1 with vertex 2? It only does linear
interpolation between the two vertices. That is the reason why we always see a
straight line between two vertices, never any curves or the like. If you like to
draw a sphere you have to approximate the sphere with simple triangles, although
this is rather inefficient (but it is simple and generic).

There is one more thing we were not talking about much. With our vertex shader
we transform our vertices so they look perspectively correct on the screen. But
vertices have three coordinates and your flat screen has only two dimensions. Do
we throw away the third coordinate (that could easily be done, but read on)?
Remember the depth buffer? The depth buffer is sometimes called z buffer and now
you may understand why. When we apply your matrix to a vertex the resulting
vertex has still all three dimensions. We assign then this vertex to o_vertex.
The GPU knows then that if there is depth buffer activated it has to do
something with this Z coordinate (only because we have assigned it to the
POSITION register). When the GPU starts to draw this triangle it interpolates
individual positions and z coordinates for possible future fragments (pixels),
based on our vertex shader output. The graphic card then checks if there is
already a z coordinate (at least the newer ones, old ones call the fragment
shader in any circumstance) in this buffer. If yes, it compares this old z
coordinate with the new. If the new z is nearer than the old (this comparison
function can be changed, but do not care about this yet), the old is overwritten
and the fragment is sent to the fragment shader.

What can a vertex shader do in general? It gets some inputs that change per
vertex (vtx_position, vtx_color, ...), some uniforms that often only change
between objects (mat_modelproj, ...) and some outputs (l_color, l_position,
...). Based on the input we calculate the outputs. The GPU then interpolates all
outputs and most of them we can read back in the fragment shader.

If we make our own shader and we can solve something with linear interpolation,
we always should consider to do this in the vertex shader, and let the GPU do
the interpolation. But sometimes linear interpolation makes things worse and so
we have to do everything in the fragment shader. Normal mapping is perfect
example, where the linear interpolation of the GPU may as well be a problem and
we have to craft carefully the vertex shader and the fragment shader.

We have a new input and a new output. vtx_color is exactly the color inside the
egg file. In the simplest case we do not modify this value and directly give it
back to the GPU. Open "List of Possible Shader Inputs" once more and try to
understand what the names mean.

    This is the same modification as in the vertex shader above. But this time
    we do it in the fragment shader. There is no visible difference, only that
    this version is inefficient. That there is no visible difference is a good
    sign, that we can do our work in the vertex shader. Maybe it is even a
    better answer than the more correct answer that says that because our
    modification does not involve any nonlinearity we do not have to do it the
    fragment shader. If it is not visible why should I waste GPU cycles,
    although it is not correct at all? Mathematicians would disagree, I guess.
